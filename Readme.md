# Data proxy Version 0.4.4


The data proxy is a node module that has pretty complex schema/model definition capabilities to automatically receive
and transmit data in a formatted and validated form.

I wrote this so you can easily submit data sent from an untrusted browser form to a backend that receives trusted JSON.

It helps validate that all defined properties are set and the right type, and formats the JSON correctly.



I use [semantic versioning][] and my [tag script][] to tag this module.

The library is fully tested with the [mocha test framework][] and the [should assertion library][]. If you contribute
please make sure that you write tests for it.


[semantic versioning]: http://semver.org/
[tag script]: https://github.com/enyo/tag
[mocha test framework]: http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/
[should assertion library]: https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js


The latest **stable** version is always in the `master` branch. The `develop` branch is
cutting edge where tests regularely won't completely pass. Only checkout the `develop` branch
if you want to contribute.


## Installation

Simply install via [npm][]:

    npm install data-proxy

or download the latest manually, and put it in `node_modules`.

[npm]: http://npmjs.org

## Configuration

Simply call `dataProxy.configure()` to configure the proxy:

    var dataProxy = require("data-proxy");
    dataProxy.configure({
        host: '10.0.0.100'
      , protocol: 'https'
      , port: 443
      , pathPrefix: '/some/path' // Without trailing slash
      , queryStringSeparator: '&'
    });

> The `pathPrefix` should not have a trailing slash.


## Define your schema

The first part to do is define your schema.  
A schema definition could look something like this:

    // /models/user.js
  
    var Schema = require('data-proxy').Schema
      , Checked = require('data-proxy').checked_types;

    var UserSchema = new Schema({
        id: Checked.Number // Since normally you simply insert the data submitted by a form, it can happen that a user
                           // submits an ID referencing an entity that does not belong to her/him. To ensure that all
                           // those are IDs are checked the «Checked.» types are used. Those attributes can't simply be
                           // generated from a submitted String (as all other attributes are), but have to be set
                           // programatically.
      , username_: String // The trailing _ means that it is required
      , password: String
      , $trusted: Boolean // The $ prefix means that this variable is private and should never be sent to the user
      , memberSince: Date
      , address: {
            street: String
          , city: String
          , countryId: Number
        }
      , friendIds: [Number]
      , favoriteFoods: [{
            name: String
          , recipe: {
              difficulty: Number
            , instructions: String
          }
        }]
    });

    // Export the User model
    module.exports = UserSchema.model('User');

And to validate and handle that model:

    // Somewhere inside your app:
    var User = require("./models/user");

    // This call automatically validates the object and throws an exception if it's invalid.
    var user = new User({ username: "sexy82", address: { street: "Downtownstreet 37" } });

If you want to handle errors differently you can pass a errorCallback:

    // During initialization
    var user = new User({ }, function(path, errorCode) {
      // handle the error
    });
    // or set the data
    var user = new User()
      , skipValidation = false;

    user.setData({ }, function(path, errorCode) { }, skipValidation);

Where `path` is the path of the key/value that caused the error starting with the model name (e.g.: User.address.city),
and `errorCode` is one of:

  - `Model.INVALID_VALUE` if the object provided an invalid value
  - `Model.INVALID_KEY` if the object provided an invalid key
  - `Model.UNDEFINED_KEY` if a required key was not provided
  - `Model.UNDEFINED_VALUE` if a required value was not provided


## Usage

Actually post a request:

    // dataProxy.post(path, body, successCallback, errorCallback);
    // Example:
    dataProxy.post(
        '/path/to/post'
      , { body: { some: "data", to: "post", as: "json" } }
      , function(response) {
          // Success
        }
      , function(err, response) {
          // Error (If the server responded with 40x oder 50x, or if the JSON was invalid.)
        }
    );


`response` is an object containing following information:

- `response.statusCode` The http status code returned (e.g.: `404`).
- `response.headers` An array of the headers returned.
- `response.data` Contains the data returned by the server.
- `response.dataObject` (optional) Contains the parsed data (if any) returned by the server.
- `response.record` (optional) If you specified the `receiveAs` option.

> If the `content-type` submitted by the server is  `application-json` then the data will automatically be parsed and is
> accessible via `response.dataObject`.


If you expect to receive a specific model, you can pass the `receiveAs` option. You will then receive the record in
the response as `response.record`. **The `dataObject` will then be the sanitized version of the data!**

    // Example:
    var User = require("./models/user");
    dataProxy.post(
        '/path/to/post'
      , { receiveAs: User }
      , function(response) {
          // Success
          // response.record is a user document, filled with the received and sanitized data.
        }
      , function(err, response) {
          // Error
        }
    );
